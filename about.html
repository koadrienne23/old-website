                    <h3>About Me.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hey, my name is Adrienne. I am originally from New York City 
                        and am currently a freshman at Dartmouth College. I am studying 
                        for a B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Spanish. I started 
                        learning to code in my Sophomore year of high school, and I now 
                        know Python, Java, Processing, and the basics of HTML, CSS, and 
                        Javascript. <br> <br>
                        On campus, Iâ€™m involved in Women in Business (WIB) as a junior 
                        associate and the Korean Students Association (KSA) as a social 
                        chair.

            <div class="dali">
                <h3>Why DALI?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think working in DALI would be a great opportunity for me to further 
                    my development skills and apply them to build interesting and rewarding 
                    projects in a group setting. Seeing all of the amazing projects during 
                    Technigala during the Fall and Winter terms made me even more excited 
                    to apply for DALI this term. I look forward to not only getting valuable 
                    work experience as a software engineer, but also being able to work with 
                    and learn from skilled peers and mentors.
